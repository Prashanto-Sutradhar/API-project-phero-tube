                <h4>var:-</h4>
                <p>The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let variable is block scope. The scope of a const variable is block scope. It can be updated and re-declared into the scope</p>
                <h4>const:-</h4>
                <p>const declarations are scoped to blocks as well as functions. const declarations can only be accessed after the line of declaration is reached (see temporal dead zone). For this reason, const declarations are commonly regarded as non-hoisted.</p>
                <h4>let:-</h4>
                <p>Compared with var , let declarations have the following differences: let declarations are scoped to blocks as well as functions. let declarations can only be accessed after the place of declaration is reached (see temporal dead zone).
                    For this reason, let declarations are commonly regarded as non-hoisted.

                <img src="./img/null-and-undfn.png" alt="">
                <h4> cases of null :-</h4>
                <p>What is the use of null? A NULL value is used to represent a missing value, but it usually has one of three different interpretations: The value unknown (value exists but is not known) Value not available (exists but is purposely withheld)</p>
                <h4> cases of undefined:-</h4>
                <p>In computing (particularly, in programming), undefined value is a condition where an expression does not have a correct value, although it is syntactically correct. An undefined value must not be confused with empty string, Boolean "false"
                    or other "empty" (but defined) values.

                <h4>REST API :-</h4>
                <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational
